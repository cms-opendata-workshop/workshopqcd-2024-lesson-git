## What is Docker?

Let's learn about Docker and why we're using it!

Regardless of what you encounter in this lesson, the definitive guide is any 
official documentation provided by [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/guides/).

 From the [Docker website](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container)


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout
*A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.*

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


In short, Docker allows a user to work in a computing environment that is well defined and has been *frozen* with respect
to interdependent libraries and code and related tools. The computing environment in the container is separate and independent from your own working area. This means that you do not have to worry about software packages that you might already have installed with a different version. 

## What can I learn here?

As much as we'd like, we can't give you a *complete* overview of Docker. However, we do hope to explain
why we run Docker in the way we do so that you gain some understanding. More specifically, we'll
be showing you how to set up Docker for not just this workshop, but for interfacing with the 
CMS open data in general



::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Docker is a set of products to deliver and run software in packages called containers.
- Software containers are widely used these days in both industry and academic research.
- We use software containers during the hands-on sessions to provide the a well-defined software environment for exercises.
