This lesson is intended for anyone having only little experience with Git ad wanting to work through some basic exercises to gain confidence.

If you are only confortable with `git clone https://github.com/<somegithubplace>/<somecoderepository>.git` to get some code locally, and the rest of Git is mostly scary, this hands-on session is for you.
